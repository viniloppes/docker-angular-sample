# Docker Angular Sample Project

This project demonstrates how to effectively containerize a modern Angular application using Docker for both **development** and **production** workflows.

It is used as part of the [official Docker Angular sample](https://docs.docker.com/guides/angular/), showcasing industry best practices for front-end containerizationâ€”including secure builds, streamlined development workflows, and optimized production delivery.
